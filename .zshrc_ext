# ==> libpq
# libpq is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
# because conflicts with postgres formula.

# If you need to have libpq first in your PATH run:
# echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/libpq/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

# For compilers to find libpq you may need to set:
# export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/libpq/lib"
# export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/libpq/include"

# For pkg-config to find libpq you may need to set:
# export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libpq/lib/pkgconfig"
